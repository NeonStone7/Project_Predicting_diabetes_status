## About Dataset

**Diabetes** is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes.



**Type 1** diabetes is an autoimmune disease that causes your body to attack the cells in your pancreas that produce insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps your body use glucose for energy.



**Type 2** diabetes is the most common type of diabetes. It occurs when your body doesn't respond normally to insulin, or when your body doesn't produce enough insulin.


**Gestational diabetes** is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. It usually goes away after the baby is born.


**Prevalence of Diabetes**:

According to the CDC BRFSS 2021, 34.1 million adults in the United States have diabetes, or 10.5% of the adult population. This number has been increasing over time. In 2010, 29.1 million adults in the United States had diabetes, or 9.3% of the adult population.

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an ongoing, state-based telephone survey that collects data about health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of preventive services among adults aged 18 years and older residing in the United States. Conducted annually by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the BRFSS has been providing valuable insights into the health status and behaviors of U.S. adults since its inception in 1984.



For this dataset, a csv of the 2021 BRFSS dataset available on Kaggle was used. The original dataset contains responses from 438,693 individuals and has 303 features. These features are either questions directly asked of participants, or calculated variables based on individual participant responses.



diabetes_012_health_indicators_BRFSS2021.csv is a clean dataset of 236,378 survey responses to the CDC's BRFSS2021. The target variable Diabetes_012 has 3 classes. 0 is for no diabetes or only during pregnancy, 1 is for prediabetes, and 2 is for diabetes. There is class imbalance in this dataset.
